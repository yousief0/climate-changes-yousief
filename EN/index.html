                Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. And these transitions could be natural,
                but since the century
                Nineteenth, human activities have become the main cause of climate change. This is mainly due to the burning of fossil
                fuels (such as coal, oil and gas), which produce heat-trapping gases.
